# Image Processing Toolbox

A powerful command-line image processing suite using PIL, featuring all the standard image editing tools, along with my own __experimental__ and __psychedelic__ visual transformations.

The text-based interface is responsive and user-friendly, featuring a REPL-style loop for navigating menus and applying effects. Reusable input prompts make for clean, maintainable code under the hood.



## Features

- REPL-style interactive menu

__Controls__

- `w` â€“ Instant preview (opens image viewer)

- `s` â€“ Save images

- `a | d` â€“ Turn pages

- `pX` â€“ Jump to page `X`

- `q` â€“ Quit

__Additional__

- Pressing `Enter` with no response will use default values

- `Cross 1` indicates `horizontal`, then `vertical`

- `Cross 1` indicates `horizontal`, then `vertical`

- Use `ctrl + c` to abort current editing session

### Effects

__ðŸ§± Page 1: Basics__

- Crop

- Flip

- Rotate

- Scale â€“ resize with an interpolation type: __nearest neighbor__, __bilinear__, or __box sampling__

- Pad

<br>

__ðŸŽ¨ Page 2: Color / Contrast__
 
- Hue Shift â€“ rotate the hue of all colors by some degree

- Resaturation

- Transformations â€“ apply brightness, contrast, gamma correction

- Show Histogram â€“ visualize the distribution of pixel intensities

- Histogram Equalization â€“ contrast enhancement by uniformly distributing intensities

- Monochrome Conversion â€“ grayscale, redscale, custom colors

- Pseudo Color 
	- False-color mapping for grayscale images using intensity heatmap or random colors

- _Color Split_
	- Choose a shape (like Y), and rip selected color channels apart from each other

- Point-based intensity transformations (for contrast)

__ðŸŒ€ Page 3: Filters & Pixel Sorting__

- Convolution Matrices
	- Create your own custom-sized kernel (for edge-detection, blur, sharpen, etc.)

		> Hint: use the non-linear median filter (5x5) to reveal the balloons

- Non-Linear Filters
	- A kernel that applies the `min`, `max`, or `median` function to neighborhoods of pixels

- Line Sort
	- Reorder lines (or chunks) of the image based on brightness, randomness, or apply a circular shift

- _Glitch Sort_
	- Experimental glitch-art effect with lots of parameters
	- Choose `rows`, `columns`, or `chunks` to rearrange
	- Adjust glitch `frequency`, `coverage`, and `direction`
	- Apply a sorting function: `brightness`, `random`, `rotate`, `wave shift`
	- Choose where the on the image the glitch starts: `top`, `bottom`, `middle`

- _Ghost Split_
	- Trippy effect where every second line of pixels is shifted in some direction, spliting the image in two and creating the illusion of a superimposed ghost image  (as our eyes fail to distinguish the tiny slits where the lines were moved)
	- Additional parameters allow you to blend the adjacent line pairs after shifting
	- You may control the direction of the split, the number of splits (the image may be subdivided for multiple ghost to form), and whether the shift is circular

<br>

__ðŸŒŠ Page 4: Warp Effects__

- Wave Warp
	- Apply a `sqaure`, `triangular`, `sin` or `sawtooth` wave distortion across the image
	- Choose wave `period`, `amplitude` and `direction`

- _Mirror_ 
	- Choose a number of mirrorsâ€”lines dividing the image vertically or horizontallyâ€”and copy one side of the mirror to the other in reverse

<br>

__ðŸŽ­  Page 5: Blending & Overlays__

- Blend Lines â€“ blend multiple rows or columns together with one of many blending modes

- Pixelate

- Overlay
	- Superimpose a secondary image onto the first one
	- You may specify a blend mode in addition to the opacity of the overlay

## Installation

1. Clone the repo:

	```bash
	git clone https://github.com/jray-8/image-toolbox.git
	```

2. Install Pillow (an updated fork of PIL):

	```bash
	pip install pillow
	```

3. Run the program:

	```bash
	python image_toolbox.py <input-image> [output-image]
	```

	- If no output is specified, the input image will be modified in-place
	- You may specify the full path to your images

	Ex.

	```bash
	python image_toolbox.py images/balloons.png images/balloons-clear.png
	```
